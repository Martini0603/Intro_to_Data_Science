## Python language

*What is Python?*
Python is a general purpose programming language that has found uses in all sorts of contexts from education to manufacturing. It is a powerful language which powers real data science workflows for Fortune 500 companies. At the same time, Python was designed to be more human-readable than other languages like C++ and Java. It uses different syntax than those languages to give programs a clear, logical flow and a preference for words over symbols. Python is also object oriented, but we won't talk about that in detail until much later in the course
