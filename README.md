# Intro Data Science
- This notebook is comprehensive collection of concepts about introduction to data science with using Python

## Python syntax and modules

[Note 1]
* Python, Jupyter, and Google Colab
* Python syntax: variables and functions
* Basic `lists` and indexing

[Note 2]
* Loading modules
* Reading data with pandas
* Working with `DataFrames`

[Note 3]
* Making charts with matplotlib (`subplots, plot`)
* Manipulating data with `for` loops

[Note 4]
* Using numpy arrays (math and indexing)
* Math and counting with numpy (`arange, linspace`)
* Computing statistics (`mean, median, max, min`)

[Note 5]
* Histograms two ways
* Using multiple subplots
* Error bars and categorical statistics

## Modeling data in Python

[Note 6]
* Correlation with `pearsonr` and `corrcoef`
* Linear regression with `linregress`
* `pearsonr` in a `for` loop
* `try/except` and duck typing

[Note 7]
* Digitizing charts with WebPlotDigitizer
* Interpolation with `interp1d`
* Function inversion with `interp1d`

[Note 8]
* Evaluating models with R-squared, MSE, MAE
* Detecting and removing outliers

## Python programming

[Note 9]
* Conditional statements (`if/then`)
* Iteration (`for, while`)
* Jump statements (`continue, break`)
* Logic (`and, or, not`) and comparisons

[Note 10]
* Function definitions
* Positional and keyword arguments
* Variable scope
* Defining functions

[Note 11]
* Formatting strings
* Unit testing
* Exceptions and errors

## Nonlinear modeling

[Note 12]
* Nonlinear transforms
* Fitting nonlinear features
* Regression vs interpolation
* Using `curve_fit`

[Note 13]
* Introduction to `scipy.optimize.minimize`
* Curve fitting with `minimize`

## Optimization

[Note 14]
* Dictionaries
* Formulating optimization problems with `minimize`
* Optimizing multiple variables with constraints

[Note 15]
* Plotting functions of multiple variables
* Regular grids vs irregular sampling
* Curve fitting in higher dimensions

## Object-oriented programming

[Note 16]
* Introduction to objects
* Classes and how to use them
* Defining custom builtin methods

[Note 17]
* Refresher about classes
* Designing useful methods
* Objects and `DataFrames`

## Advanced Visualization

[Note 18]
* List comprehension
* Using `plotly` to visualize `DataFrames`
* 3D charts with `plotly`

[Note 19]
* Triangulated surfaces
* Drawing smooth curves in 3D

## Machine learning

[Note 20]
