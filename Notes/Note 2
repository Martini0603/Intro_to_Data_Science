1. Modules
  NumPy
  : numpy is so widespread it might as well be considered part of the Python language. 
  Basically any program with mathematical equations or data manipulation uses NumPy. 
  This includes the other modules we're about to look at!

  Matplotlib
  : matplotlib is one of the most popular visualization libraries for Python (although there are others). 
  Its name comes from its inspiration from the MATLAB plotting library. If you've used MATLAB, this will look familiar.

  SciPy
  : scipy is a more specialized package for scientific computing. It includes things like integration, optimization, and statistical distributions.

  Pandas
  : pandas is a library for reading, writing, and analyzing data. 
  It contains wrappers to do a lot of the things these other libraries do (by calling their functions behind the scenes). 
  While we will use all four of these in class, you may end up mostly relying on Pandas "in the wild."
  
2. Importing modules
  
  import numpy
  
3. Aliases
  
  import numpy as np

4. Dataframes
  - documentation
  at: Access a single value for a row/column label pair.
  loc: Access a group of rows and columns by label(s) or a boolean array.
  iat: Access a single value for a row/column pair by integer position.
  iloc: Purely integer-location based indexing for selection by position.
  
  # using `loc[]` with [index][column]
  # using `iloc[]` with [index_integer, column_integer]
