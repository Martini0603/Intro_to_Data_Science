## Modules
: Python modules are pieces of code that other people have written and posted on the internet for free distribution. 
  NumPy
  : numpy is so widespread it might as well be considered part of the Python language. 
  Basically any program with mathematical equations or data manipulation uses NumPy. 
  This includes the other modules we're about to look at!

  Matplotlib
  : matplotlib is one of the most popular visualization libraries for Python (although there are others). 
  Its name comes from its inspiration from the MATLAB plotting library. If you've used MATLAB, this will look familiar.

  SciPy
  : scipy is a more specialized package for scientific computing. It includes things like integration, optimization, and statistical distributions.

  Pandas
  : pandas is a library for reading, writing, and analyzing data. 
  It contains wrappers to do a lot of the things these other libraries do (by calling their functions behind the scenes). 
  While we will use all four of these in class, you may end up mostly relying on Pandas "in the wild."
